# Hotel Booking Prediction

This project focuses on predicting hotel reservations using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The dataset contains historical booking data, and the goal is to develop a predictive model to determine whether a reservation will be honored or canceled. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training.

For exploratory data analysis, open the Jupyter notebooks inside the notebooks/ directory


## Required Libraries
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter


## Files and Dataset
 - `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with data exploration, visualization, and modeling.
- `src/`: Scripts for data preprocessing and machine learning model implementation.
- `models/`: Saved trained models.
- `reports/`: Generated reports and visualizations from the analysis.

## Data

*Fake Hotel* has two branches: one located in the state capital, "City Hotel," and another in a coastal community, "Resort Hotel."

The data they provided is in CSV format, where each row represents a reservation with the following attributes:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('hotel_bookings_training.csv')
```
